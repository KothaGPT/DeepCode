# Examples

For now we only have a limited amount of examples listed in the table below. Note that you can also
look at how the [matmul](https://github.com/kothagpt/deepcode/tree/main/crates/deepcl-matmul) is
implemented. Don't hesitate to contribute more examples to the DeepCL repository!

| Example                                                                                 | Description                                                                                             |

| [GeLU](https://github.com/kothagpt/deepcode/tree/main/examples/gelu)                     | Implement the GeLU activation function using DeepCL.                                                    |
| [Sum Things](https://github.com/kothagpt/deepcode/tree/main/examples/sum_things)         | Sum some numbers using many different variations leveraging the DeepCL core features and trait support. |
| [Normalization](https://github.com/kothagpt/deepcode/tree/main/examples/normalization)   | Show how to use normalization on vectorized elements.                                                   |
| [Device Sharing](https://github.com/kothagpt/deepcode/tree/main/examples/device_sharing) | Share a WGPU device with DeepCL and other service.                                                      |
| [Fusing](https://github.com/kothagpt/deepcode/tree/main/examples/fusing)                 | Use comptime to select operation                                                                        |
