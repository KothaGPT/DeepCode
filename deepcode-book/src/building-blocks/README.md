# Building Blocks

In this section, we'll guide you through the core elements that make up Deepcode. We'll walk you through

As you explore Deepcode, you might notice that we occasionally draw comparisons to PyTorch. We believe
it can provide a smoother learning curve and help you grasp the nuances more effectively.
